# This is a sample Anselus server config file. Each value listed below is the default value.
# Every effort has been made to set this file to sensible defaults so that configuration is
# kept to a minimum. This file is expected to be found in /etc/anselus-server/serverconfig.toml 
# or in the same directory as the executable, also named serverconfig.toml in that location.

[database]
# The database section, in theory, should be the only real editing for this file.
#
# Currently only PostgresQL is supported, but the 'engine' parameter exists for future expansion.
# engine = "postgresql"
# ip = "127.0.0.1"
# port = "5432"
# name = "anselus"
# user = "anselus"
password = ""

# [network]
# The interface and port to listen on
# listen_ip = "127.0.0.1"
# port = "2001"

# [global]
# The location where workspace data is stored
# workspace_dir = "/var/anselus"
# 
# The type of registration. 'public' is open to outside registration requests, and would be 
# appropriate only for hosting a public free server. 'moderated' is open to public registration, 
# but an administrator must approve the request before an account can be created. 'private' permits 
# account registration only by an administrator. For most workflows, private is appropriate.
# registration = "private"
#
# The default storage quota for a workspace, measured in MiB. 0 means no limit.
# default_quota = 0

# [security]
# The number of seconds to wait after a login failure before accepting another attempt
# failure_delay_sec = 3
# 
# The number of login failures made before a connection is closed. 
# max_failures = 5
# 
# The number of minutes the client must wait after reaching max_failures before another attempt
# may be made. Note that additional attempts to login prior to the completion of this delay resets 
# the timeout.
# lockout_delay_min = 15
# 
# The delay, in minutes, between account registration requests from the same IP address. This is 
# to prevent registration spam
# registration_delay_min = 15
# 
# Device checking enables an extra layer of security, checking the identity of a device for a 
# workspace by exchanging a random key which is updated every time that device logs in.
